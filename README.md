# Password-Generator
##Description
This site generates a random password between 8-128 characters by clicking on the generate button and following some prompts
##Tools

##Roadmap
Hopefully as I continue to learn more about Javascript I will be able to fix some of the bugs in this program. For example, I cannot get the prompt boxes to stop popping up if the character length is not met.
##Special Thanks to instructor Fil for the guidence and help with the code
